 * Reference https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-read-an-often-changing-value-from-usecallback
 *
 * In some rare cases you might need to memoize a callback with useCallback but the memoization doesnâ€™t work very well because the inner function has to be re-created too often.
 * For super-complex subcomponents, re-rendering can impact performance. With usePersistFn, you can guarantee that the function reference will never change.
